# Ordinance Topic Modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation

Motivation: Ordinances are in great number and not organized in any way in their respective websites.

Topic modeling is capable with this task by organizing them into themes/topics. 
By applying topic modeling on these ordinances, may provide a new perspective in creation of new policies. 
Â 
To accomplish this task I used _gensim_ python module for LDA model estimation to make inference of topic distribution on these ew, unseen documents.
